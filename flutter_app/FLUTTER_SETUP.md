# Flutter Web Deployment - Resolved Issues

## Issue Resolution ✅

Fixed the file_picker plugin configuration issues that were preventing web deployment:

### Problems Solved:
- ❌ **File Picker Plugin Conflicts**: Removed problematic `file_picker_config.yaml` that was causing desktop platform errors
- ❌ **Plugin Configuration Errors**: Eliminated references to file_picker for platforms that don't support it
- ❌ **Web Deployment Failures**: Fixed dependency conflicts for clean web builds

### Solutions Applied:
- ✅ **Clean Dependencies**: Removed file_picker, using image_picker for web-compatible photo uploads
- ✅ **Web-Only Focus**: Added `image_picker_for_web` for web platform support
- ✅ **Proper Configuration**: Clean pubspec.yaml without desktop platform conflicts
- ✅ **PWA Ready**: Complete web directory with manifest.json and index.html
