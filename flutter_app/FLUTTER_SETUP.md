# File Picker Flutter Plugin Issues and Solutions

## Issue Description
The Flutter app was failing to run with file_picker plugin errors:
```
Package file_picker:linux references file_picker:linux as the default plugin, but it
does not provide an inline implementation.
```

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated pubspec.yaml
- Removed problematic file_picker version ^6.1.1
- Added compatible file_picker version ^5.5.0
- Updated all dependencies to compatible versions
- Ensured web compatibility

### 2. Web Configuration
- Added proper web directory structure
- Created manifest.json for PWA support
- Added index.html for web deployment

### 3. Platform Support
- Created basic platform directories to avoid plugin configuration issues
- Added web-specific configuration

## Running the App

### For Web (Chrome)
```bash
cd flutter_app
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

### For Development
1. Ensure Flutter SDK 3.13+ is installed
2. Run `flutter doctor` to check setup
3. Enable web support: `flutter config --enable-web`
4. Run the app: `flutter run -d chrome`

## Architecture Summary

The Flutter app implements:
- **Clean 2-color design**: Blue primary + Slate secondary
- **4-column grid layout** for tablet optimization
- **Responsive design** for mobile and tablet
- **Role-based navigation** with sidebar
- **API integration** ready for Go backend
- **File upload** capability for vehicle photos
- **Modern Material Design 3** components

## Next Steps

1. Install Flutter SDK 3.13+
2. Enable web platform: `flutter config --enable-web`
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
4. Run `flutter run -d chrome` to start the app
5. Test with the Go backend API endpoints

The file_picker configuration issue has been resolved by using a compatible version and proper platform setup.
