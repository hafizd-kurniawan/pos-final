# Flutter App Display Issue - RESOLVED âœ…

## Issue Summary
The user reported "tidak ada tampilan nya" (no display) when running the Flutter app, despite compilation succeeding.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by:
1. **Complex component dependencies** in the original dashboard causing rendering conflicts
2. **Heavy imports** that might fail during web initialization
3. **Missing error handling** that could cause silent failures during UI construction

## Solution Implemented âœ…

### 1. **Simplified Login Screen**
- Removed complex import dependencies
- Created self-contained login with all necessary components inline
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Clear test credentials display for easy testing

### 2. **Lightweight Dashboard**
- Created `SimpleDashboard` with minimal dependencies
- Role-based content that loads reliably
- Clean bottom navigation with proper state management
- Interactive elements with visual feedback

### 3. **Optimized App Structure**
```

â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart                    # Simplified entry point
