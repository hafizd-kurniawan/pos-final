## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.13.0 or later)
- Dart SDK (3.1.0 or later)
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Go backend API running (see main project README)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pos-final/pos_flutter_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure API endpoint**:
   Edit `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`:
   ```dart
   static const String apiBaseUrl = 'http://your-backend-url:8080/api/v1';
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   # For development
   flutter run
   
   # For web
   flutter run -d chrome
   
   # For Android
   flutter run -d android
   
   # For iOS
   flutter run -d ios
   ```

### Demo Credentials

Use these credentials to test different user roles:

- **Admin**: `admin` / `password`
- **Kasir**: `kasir` / `password`  
- **Mekanik**: `mekanik` / `password`

## API Integration

The app is designed to work with the Go backend API. Key endpoints:

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `GET /auth/profile` - Get user profile
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refresh token

### Vehicles
- `GET /vehicles` - List vehicles with filtering
- `POST /vehicles` - Create new vehicle
- `GET /vehicles/:id` - Get vehicle details
- `POST /files/vehicles/:id/photo` - Upload vehicle photos

### Sales & Purchases
- `GET /sales` - List sales invoices
- `POST /sales` - Create new sale
- `GET /pdf/sales/:id` - Generate PDF invoice

## Configuration

### Theme Customization
Edit `lib/core/constants/app_theme.dart` to customize:
- Colors (primary, secondary, status colors)
- Typography (font family, text styles)
- Spacing and border radius

### API Configuration
Edit `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart` to modify:
- API base URL
- File upload limits
- Pagination settings
- Cache duration

## Development Guidelines

### State Management
- Use Provider pattern for app-wide state
- Individual providers for different features (Auth, Vehicle, etc.)
- Keep providers focused and single-responsibility

### File Organization
- Group by feature, not by file type
- Keep related screens and widgets together
- Use barrel exports for clean imports

### UI/UX Principles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Consistent spacing using AppSpacing constants
- Material Design 3 components
- Accessibility support
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Build & Deployment

flutter build apk --debug
flutter build web --debug
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Android
flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release

# iOS
